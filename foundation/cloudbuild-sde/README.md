# Terraform Module for Provisioning Cloud Build Service Account IAM Roles and Cloud Build triggers

## Branching Strategy

This stage performs two tasks:
- Create pipelines to run each task
- Create an environment

The purpose of this directory is to apply defined IAM roles to a Cloud Build Service Account at the folder level.

## General Usage

1. From a best practice approach a new branch should generally be created from the `master` or `main` branch when working on new features or updates.
    1. Run `git checkout -b <BRANCH_NAME>`
1. Change into the desired directory that needs to have infrastructure code updated.
1. Edit either the `main.tf`, `variables.tf`, or `terraform.tfvars` file, depending on what needs to be updated.
1. If there are variables which are needed but not present in the `.tfvars` file those can be added and updated as needed.
1. In order to limit any auto-approved changes being made to your infrastructure there are two options.
    1. If you want to merge back into master you can edit out any `apply` steps within the Cloud Build YAML file that this pipeline is associated to so that only an `init` and `plan` are ran to show what the potential Terraform changes will do.
    1. If you are working out of a feature branch you can create a new Cloud Build trigger to monitor the feature branch, create a new Cloud Build YAML with only an `init` and `plan` step, then verify that the `plan` output is good to proceed forward with.
1. Save your files, `git add <files>`, `git commit -m "<MESSAGE>"`, `git push`.
1. If you were working out of a feature branch you can merge back into `master`.
    1. `git checkout <master or main>`, `git merge <FEATURE_BRANCH> --no-ff`
1. A manual pipeline run may need to be started after a merge is done if no edits have been done on the `included_files` after the merge. These are generally the `.tfvars` files which are monitored for changes to start the pipeline.

Below is an example of how to update the `.tfvars` file in order to update IAM roles for the Cloud Build Service account.

```diff
iam_role_list = [
  "roles/bigquery.dataOwner",
  "roles/cloudbuild.builds.builder",
  "roles/composer.environmentAndStorageObjectAdmin",
  "roles/compute.instanceAdmin.v1",
  "roles/compute.networkAdmin",
  "roles/iam.serviceAccountAdmin",
  "roles/iam.serviceAccountUser",
  "roles/pubsub.admin",
  "roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator",
  "roles/resourcemanager.projectIamAdmin",
  "roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageConsumer",
+ "roles/storage.admin",
+ "roles/pubsub.viewer"
]
