# NOTE
# As of 3/7/23 could not scope a VPC SC down to a folder because the Google SDK requires this to be set from a service account vs a user account.
/*
1. The manual steps are to go to Google Console
2. Go to Security > VPC-SC (make sure you're at the Org level and not at project or folder level)
3. Select Manage Policies > + Create
4. Name the policy, assign at the desired folder level, and grant user and Cloud Build SA
5. Record the policy id and add to the foundation/vpc-sc/env/terraform.tfvars file
